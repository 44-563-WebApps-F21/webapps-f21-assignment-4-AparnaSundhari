    <p class="speech ALGERNON">That is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first
        train on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am
        anxious . . . to miss?</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">Couldnâ€™t you miss it anywhere but in London?</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="speech ALGERNON">No: the appointment is in London.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <h6 class="speech CECILY">Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business
        engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but
        still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he
        wants to speak to you about your emigrating.</h6>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="speech ALGERNON">About my what?</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">Your emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.</p>
