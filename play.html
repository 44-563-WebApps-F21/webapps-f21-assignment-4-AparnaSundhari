    <h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>

    <h3>Garden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the
        house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,
        July. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a
        large yew-tree.
    </h3>


    CECILY.
    [Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political
    Economy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!

    [Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]

    MERRIMAN.
    Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has
    brought his luggage with him.

    CECILY.
    [Takes the card and reads it.] ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,
    W.’ Uncle Jack’s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?

    MERRIMAN.
    Yes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and
    Miss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you
    privately for a moment.

    CECILY.
    Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to
    the housekeeper about a room for him.

    MERRIMAN.
    Yes, Miss.

    [Merriman goes off.]

    CECILY.
    I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather
    frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.

    [Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!

    ALGERNON.
    [Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.

    CECILY.
    You are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe
    I am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken
    aback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are
    Uncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.

    ALGERNON.
    Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think
    that I am wicked.

    CECILY.
    If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very
    inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,
    pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would
    be hypocrisy.

    ALGERNON.
    [Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.

    CECILY.
    I am glad to hear it.

    ALGERNON.
    In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own
    small way.

    CECILY.
    I don’t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must
    have been very pleasant.

    ALGERNON.
    It is much pleasanter being here with you.

    CECILY.
    I can’t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won’t be back
    till Monday afternoon.
