    <h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>

    <h3>Garden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the
        house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,
        July. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a
        large yew-tree.
    </h3>


    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Picks up books and throws them back on table.]</p> 
    <p class="speech CECILY">Horrid Political Economy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]</p>

    <h6 class="name">MERRIMAN.</h6>
    <p class="speech MERRIMAN">Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has
    brought his luggage with him.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Takes the card and reads it.]</p> <p class="speech CECILY">‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,
    W.’ Uncle Jack’s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?</p>

    <h6 class="name">MERRIMAN.</h6>
    <p class="speech MERRIMAN">Yes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and
    Miss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you
    privately for a moment.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to
    the housekeeper about a room for him.</p>

    <h6 class="name">MERRIMAN.</h6>
    <p class="speech MERRIMAN">Yes, Miss.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[Merriman goes off.]</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather
    frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Raising his hat.]</p> <p class="speech ALGERNON">You are my little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">You are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe
    I am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken
    aback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are
    Uncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="speech ALGERNON">Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think
    that I am wicked.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very
    inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,
    pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would
    be hypocrisy.</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Looks at her in amazement.]</p> <p class="speech ALGERNON">Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">I am glad to hear it.</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="speech ALGERNON">In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own
    small way.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">I don’t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must
    have been very pleasant.</p>

    <h6 class="name">ALGERNON.</h6>
    <p class="speech ALGERNON">It is much pleasanter being here with you.</p>

    <h6 class="name">CECILY.</h6>
    <p class="speech CECILY">I can’t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won’t be back
    till Monday afternoon.</p>
