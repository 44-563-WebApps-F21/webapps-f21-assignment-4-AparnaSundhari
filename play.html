    <h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>

    <h3>Garden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the
        house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,
        July. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a
        large yew-tree.
    </h3>

    <p style="white-space: pre">
        CECILY.
        [Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political
        Economy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!

        [Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]

        MERRIMAN.
        Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has
        brought his luggage with him.

        CECILY.
        [Takes the card and reads it.] ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,
        W.’ Uncle Jack’s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?

        MERRIMAN.
        Yes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and
        Miss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you
        privately for a moment.

        CECILY.
        Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to
        the housekeeper about a room for him.

        MERRIMAN.
        Yes, Miss.

        [Merriman goes off.]

        CECILY.
        I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather
        frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.

        [Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!

        ALGERNON.
        [Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.

        CECILY.
        You are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe
        I am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken
        aback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are
        Uncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.

        ALGERNON.
        Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think
        that I am wicked.

        CECILY.
        If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very
        inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,
        pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would
        be hypocrisy.

        ALGERNON.
        [Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.

        CECILY.
        I am glad to hear it.

        ALGERNON.
        In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own
        small way.

        CECILY.
        I don’t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must
        have been very pleasant.

        ALGERNON.
        It is much pleasanter being here with you.

        CECILY.
        I can’t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won’t be back
        till Monday afternoon.

        ALGERNON.
        That is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first
        train on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am
        anxious . . . to miss?

        CECILY.
        Couldn’t you miss it anywhere but in London?

        ALGERNON.
        No: the appointment is in London.

        CECILY.
        Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business
        engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but
        still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he
        wants to speak to you about your emigrating.

        ALGERNON.
        About my what?

        CECILY.
        Your emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.

        ALGERNON.
        I certainly wouldn’t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in
        neckties at all.

        CECILY.
        I don’t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to
        Australia.

        ALGERNON.
        Australia! I’d sooner die.

        CECILY.
        Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to
        choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.

        ALGERNON.
        Oh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,
        are not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,
        cousin Cecily.

        CECILY.
        Yes, but are you good enough for it?

        ALGERNON.
        I’m afraid I’m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might
        make that your mission, if you don’t mind, cousin Cecily.

        CECILY.
        I’m afraid I’ve no time, this afternoon.
